"""Encrypts/decrypts each user's own IBKR credentials at rest, so the DB
file (or a backup of it) never holds a plaintext broker password - not
even the admin can read it back out. Symmetric (Fernet/AES-128-CBC + HMAC)
since the same process that encrypts also has to decrypt it later, to hand
the plaintext to IBC at Gateway login time.

The key is loaded lazily (only when encrypt/decrypt is actually called),
not at import time - this module is imported by web/app.py alongside
everything else the dashboard serves, so a deploy that hasn't set
CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY yet must not crash the whole dashboard, only
the (currently unused) credentials feature.
